# Final_Project
This is a collaboration between myself and two other teammates (Kim Plozin and La-Vie Borde)
We will be answering the question--How does WFH setup and technical support contribute to employee satisfaction and burnout?
This will be done by data wrangling two datasets that will both be used in analysis.  
We will also be testing for assumptions.
